# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 15 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). In this 20‑hour tutorial (split into two parts), you’ll build your own multi‑vendor e-commerce app where creators have their own storefronts, sell digital products, and get paid through Stripe Connect. It’s a solid, practical project that walks you through how modern platforms are made.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
npm install
# or yarn install
# or pnpm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
# or bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`; it supports hot reloading.
